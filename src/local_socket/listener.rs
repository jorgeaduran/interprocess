/// ```no_run
/// use interprocess::local_socket::{LocalSocketListener, LocalSocketStream, NameTypeSupport};
/// use std::io::{self, prelude::*, BufReader};
///
/// // Define a function that checks for errors in incoming connections. We'll use this to filter
/// // through connections that fail on initialization for one reason or another.
/// fn handle_error(conn: io::Result<LocalSocketStream>) -> Option<LocalSocketStream> {
///     match conn {
///         Ok(c) => Some(c),
///         Err(e) => {
///             eprintln!("Incoming connection failed: {e}");
///             None
///         }
///     }
/// }
//// // Pick a name. There isn't a helper function for this, mostly because it's largely unnecessary:
/// // in Rust, `match` is your concise, readable and expressive decision making construct.
/// let name = {
///     // This scoping trick allows us to nicely contain the import inside the `match`, so that if
///     // any imports of variants named `Both` happen down the line, they won't collide with the
///     // enum we're working with here. Maybe someone should make a macro for this.
///     use NameTypeSupport::*;
///     match NameTypeSupport::query() {
///         OnlyPaths => "/tmp/example.sock",
///         OnlyNamespaced | Both => "@example.sock",
///     }
/// };
///
/// // Bind our listener.
/// let listener = match LocalSocketListener::bind(name) {
///     Err(e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::AddrInUse => {
///         // One important problem that is easy to handle improperly (or not at all) is the
///         // "corpse sockets" that are left when a program that uses a file-type socket name
///         // terminates its socket server without deleting the file. There's no single strategy
///         // for handling this kind of address-already-occupied error. Services that are supposed
///         // to only exist as a single instance running on a system should check if another
///         // instance is actually running, and if not, delete the socket file. In this example,
///         // we leave this up to the user, but in a real application, you usually don't want to do
///         // that.

/// };

/// // The syncronization between the server and client, if any is used, goes here.
/// eprintln!("Server running at {name}");
///
/// // Preemptively allocate a sizeable buffer for reading at a later moment. This size should be
/// // enough and should be easy to find for the allocator. Since we only have one concurrent
/// // client, there's no need to reallocate the buffer repeatedly.
/// let mut buffer = String::with_capacity(128);
///
/// for conn in listener.incoming().filter_map(handle_error) {
///     // Wrap the connection into a buffered reader right away
///     // so that we could read a single line out of it.
///     let mut conn = BufReader::new(conn);
///     println!("Incoming connection!");
///
///     // Since our client example writes first, the server should read a line and only then send a
///     // response. Otherwise, because reading and writing on a connection cannot be simultaneous
///     // without threads or async, we can deadlock the two processes by having both sides wait for
///     // the write buffer to be emptied by the other.
///     conn.read_line(&mut buffer)?;
///
///     // Now that the read has come through and the client is waiting on the server's write, do
///     // it. (`.get_mut()` is to get the writer, `BufReader` doesn't implement a pass-through
///     // `Write`.)
///     conn.get_mut().write_all(b"Hello from server!\n")?;
///
///     // Print out the result, getting the newline for free!
///     print!("Client answered: {buffer}");

///     // Let's add an exit condition to shut the server down gracefully.
///     if buffer == "stop\n" {
///         break;
